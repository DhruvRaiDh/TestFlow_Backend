BugSheet.tsx:67 Sending AI Prompt: When a customer places a pre-order (e.g., today’s date is 8th and the pre-order is for the 10th), after the order moves from New Orders to In-Progress, the pre-order status is not shown in the POS system. Additionally, on the In-Progress page beside the Order ID, the displayed date and time correspond to when the order was accepted, instead of showing the actual pre-order date and time entered by the customer.
